      AU WG joining us for an afternoon at F2F in Bristol?
      
        We are moving forward with holding a face2face meeting in Bristol, England 5 and 6 October. 
        It has been proposed that the Authoring Tool Working Group join us to discuss the revision of WCAG on the afternoon of the 6th. 
        How do people feel about this opportunity to discuss the current state of the draft with another working group? 
        Do you feel we will need the full two days to work on the draft?

        WL: I believe that it is mandatory to discuss states of the draft as they are reached to help avoid possible oversights and conflicts. 
        I believe that it will take far more than the two full days to work on the draft and that a meeting involving AU will constitute &amp;quot;working on the draft.&amp;quot; 
        I may be the only one who's on five (count 'em 5) Working Groups and even though there is some personnel overlap, the groups do &amp;quot;feel&amp;quot; different. 
        It (Bristol) is something to look forward to and prepare for. 
        I hope it works out because the WAI's influence on the overall W3C and the strength-through-diversity we're achieving is a great model for just about everything and it's starting to bear fruit.

        Could you please advise me who will be attending? 
        is there an agenda? 
        would it be helpful, if I was present?

        We have not begun registration, but it appears that the core WCAG members (those who have been attending teleconference calls regularly) will be able to attend the WCAG meetings on Thursday and Friday (5 &amp;amp;amp; 6 October). 
        I'm not sure who from the Authoring Tool Working Group will join us on Friday afternoon. 
        &amp;gt; is there an agenda? 
        There is not yet a detailed agenda, although the main point of the meetings is to discuss the next revision of WCAG. 
        &amp;gt; would it be helpful, if I was present? 
        sure. 
        &amp;gt; with someone with learning difficulties? 
        even better. 
        &amp;gt; to demonstrate problems regarding web accessibility? 
        Sounds interesting!

        Hi, I am new to the grope, so I am sorry to ask for repeat information. 
        I would like to know the details of this meeting, so that I can try to come.

        Thanks Wendy for this really positive response. 
        I do hope I have not gone overboard with enthusiasm, and realise that you may all have a few other matters arising. 
        I can gassbag on for ever, but would you all (ok most or even some) like to see some commercial graphics/multimedia software designed to be used by Learning Difficulties clients for authoring. 
        I have 2 packages in mind, together with a variety of printed documents, from a number of different sources. 
        Also, why Bristol, London is a good bit more convenient for me, and a LD client? 
        I might also be able to organise a visit to a LD day centre for interested parties.
