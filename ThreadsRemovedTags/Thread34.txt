      aural style sheets
      
        I don't know of any screen-readers or speaking browsers that support aural style sheets. 
        Does anyone?

        Will this run on Windows (using Cygwin?)?

        Well, there is apparently a project to make it run under Windows in Japanese as well as english, but my japanese is not good enough to read the explanation pages. 
        Anyone out there who can help?
