      RE: Meeting today - possible partial regrets
      
        Don't know how long this meeting is going to take but with a joint meeting &amp;quot;long&amp;quot; seems more likely than &amp;quot;short&amp;quot;. 
        So just in case: 
        I have another (phone) meeting coming up at 3:30 Boston time (1 hour after this one) so if we haven't finished by then, I'll have leave early. 
        Tried to move it but that was just not possible.

      Techniques draft with added structure
      
        Hi all, Sorry about the delay, but this is the Techniques draft that I said I would do at the face-to-face. 
        It is not done but you will get the idea. 
        Language specific things have generally been removed (to be put in the separate docs).

        Jan, thanks for this 
        - it's a good piece of work. 
        How about we have the following categories: 
        + Things you need to do to meet the checkpoint (these can be fairly general) 
        + Techniques to do this (which should say how much of it they do) 
        + Things which are good to do although they go beyond the requirements of the checkpoint. 
        + References 
        These probably need to be sorted (where applicable) by tool type and priority. 
        For example to meet checkpoint 1.1 in a level-A tool, all that needs to be done is to provide source editing (and meet checkpoint 1.2 Preserve all accessibiltiy information, which can be done by not messing up the source). 
        But for a WYSIWYG tool this will not conform to 5.1 and 5.2, so the tool cannot get to double-A. 
        A source editing tool can use this technique to any level.

      Re: Techniques with added structure
      
        I agree. 
        I'd really like to work on emphasizing cross-over situations in which doing one thing contributes to meeting several guidelines. 
        In the end this could be pulled out into a separate list of techniques that need to be implemented as opposed to checkpoints that need to be met.
