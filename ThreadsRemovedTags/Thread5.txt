      September F2F
      
         We are trying to do advanced planning for a F2F in September. 

         Because of the membership overlap with the OASIS BPEL TC, we would like to try and co-locate with their meetings. 
         This is not a joint meeting, and is being proposed purely to ease travel logistics and members' costs. 

         The OASIS TC is proposing to meet 17 (afternoon), 18, and 19 September, either in Seattle or Germany. 
         Thus it makes sense to try and meet on 15, 16, and 17 (Morning) September. 

         Can people check their diaries for these dates and inform the chairs asap. 

         SAP have offered to host the meeting in Germany (thanks Kevin), but should the BPEL TC decide to meet in Seattle, we would need to find a host. 

         Offers gratefully accepted.

         mm1: This overlaps with SunNetworks. 
         Could we investigate trying the next week?

         It's certainly possible, but we shouldn't get into an n-phase transaction: 

         if its in germany those that want to attend both meetings get a weekend in Heidelburg. 

         If BPEl decides to meet in Seattle I'm not sure many would have such a weekend stayover. 

         Of course of bpel meet the following week ... 

         You see where I'm going with this!
