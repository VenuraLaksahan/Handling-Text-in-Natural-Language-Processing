      legal case Ryan air
      
        BlankIt a appears another interesting case goes to court today where a wheel chair user is seeking compensation from London Stanstead Airport and Ryan Air for charging ?18.00 for the use of a wheelchair and lift to get onto the plane. 

        I realise it is the Airlines that take the flak for this, but I believe it is the Airport authority that makes the charge?? 

        I think he has an open and shut case, but the outcome will be interesting, and I believe the airline and airport are only contesting the case as this sets a precedent to supply a reasonable service for all disabled travellers, world wide. 

        Shame on them

        When I worked for a tourism dot-com some years ago we weren't shy about suggesting that customers sue over this (it wasn't our company policy to do so, but individually we were outraged and didn't hide it).

        IIRC the airlines are customers of the airport, not the passengers. 
        They charge the airlines for the use of the wheelchair lifts, I don't think any other airline passes the charge on the customer, whereas Ryan Air pass *everything* onto the customer.

        Interesting case. 
        What is the relevance to Web Accessibility?

        Please, this has nothing to do with web accessibility. 
        Take it up off-list.

        You're right, off-topic-itis has got me again. 
        Sorry.

        Naturally you are forgiven :-) 

        Actually I think there are some potentially interesting legal ramifications 
        - if passing the cost of accessibility to the customer is found to be legal then it suggests a particular way to pay for what appeared to be already legally necessary accessibility improvements, at least in Australia and the UK. 

        But without providing some relevance to the topic of this list, which is web accessibility, I would prefer not to have more mail than I already get. 
        Fora for general discussion of accessibility law are available...

        in the USA it is expressly forbidden to pass the cost to the consumer.
