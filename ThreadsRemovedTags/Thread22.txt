      Usability testing
      
        I need to help assemble and populate a small computer lab to examine web usability issues. 
        This is a very large ballpark and I need to narrow the options we're going to explore. 

        I'm seeking your opinion about what tools we should test with. 
        We have to start someplace and picking a specific set of tools seems to be a reasonable place. 
        I gather that there's no such thing as a perfect list but I need to put one together anyway. 

        I'd like to hear about your opinions and preferences about tools if you care to share them. 
        I suspect a public forum is not the best place to share these sentiments. 
        Please respond privately so I don't get shot for starting another browser war.

        I'd use Netscape 3.x and 4.x, a version of MS Internet Explorer (as you can't have two versions on the same machine to my knowledge), a text browser such as lynx., PwWebSpeak for the voice browser and maybe Opera if you have extra time and money. 
        Also to be considered is the use of a general screen reader such as Jaws For Windows. 
        Use of tools such as bobby and HTML validators is also essential. 
        It might be sensible to have disabled users actually do the testing.

        I'm replying publicly because this is an important issue which is facing a lot of people, not just you. 
        (You are just the 1% prepared to put their hand up and ask...) 

        I would skip IE/Netscape, since designers worth 2c can tell you already how things work there by reading the code. 
        The first thing I would do is validate the HTML and check with Bobby, but read the results and think about it rather than simply believing what you're told. 

        For browsers I would look at Lynx, a screen reader (eg winvision, or jaws) and a proper audio browser like pwWebSpeak. 
        If you can, use WebTV and a Macintosh version of things 
        - this will generally show up the problems much faster. 

        The key is to learn where the problems arise so you can cut back the test/repair cycle. 
        It is a great efficiency if you can solve the problems by design rather than by repair.

        Ok, who has some good reference URLs for WebTV?

        As a reference, please see www.eeicom.com/dcwebmasters/pwd and click on the link for PWD presentation. 
        I would show you exactly where to go, but having connectivity problems with the work server. 

        They must be having a problem. 

        I can't connect this morning but I'll try later. 

        Thanks for the suggestion.

        FYI, "EEI Communications" was off-line this morning and is now operational.

        &gt; If you can, use WebTV 

        By the way, if you weren't aware, there's an emulator for WebTV that runs on Windows 95/* and Macintosh that you can download from developer.webtv.net. 
        I recommend it to my accessibility class students, since the more browsers you expose someone to, the quicker they realize that the web is designed to support ANY valid user agent, not just "the big two".
