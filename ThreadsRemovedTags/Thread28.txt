      Thank you!	  
      
        Thank you for the url. 
        I scanned through this fascinating site this morning and will forward this information to the ADA compliance officer who works with this project. 
        Thanks, too, for asking about the effect of the animated gifs on people with epilepsy. 
        This is the first time that I have ever seen such a question. 
        I have a epilepsy from being electrocuted. 
        I did not have difficulty with these animations. 
        What triggers my seizures is color mixtures, especially any combination of red/blue/yellow, and the movements need to be fast like with a turning signal on a car ahead of me in a turning lane, an emergency vehicle, flashing advertising boards, and the like. 
        Your gifs are slow, are black and white mostly, and are simple movements, not swaying or twirling. 

        Again, good work! 
        I was doing my dissertation in the area of online instructional design and cognition. 
        After my accident I had to change that. 
        I'm pleased to see that someone is actually doing something to make reading and communication more possible in this text-heavy learning environment.

        please excuse cross-posting, I have copied this too the list as there has been some discussion over the past 24 months as to the use or lack thereof of animation

		WL: I wish I could understand the notion of making reading more possible within an environment that wasn't "text-heavy". 
        Perhaps it would be "nice" for people for whom text is a problem but just how is it "possible". 

        In at least the commonest definition of the word "read", the matter that one reads is "text". 
        I understand the part about "communication" not requiring a "text-heavy" environment, but not "reading".

        This isn't necessarily the case, William. 
        There is a lot of reading that is non-textual. 

        I _highly_ recommend, to everyone on this list, the book "Understanding Comics" by Scott McCloud. 
        It deals with the (U.S.) comic book medium and has some interesting thoughts and concepts on the "language of comics" as a blend between graphical and text media. 

        In fact, I have it on the shelf behind me at work as I type this, beside my XHTML, XSLT, CSS, usability, and disability references.

        Jonathan - I was wondering if you would explain your work in this area. 
        I am currently doing an MSc in Computer Studies and my project is looking at web accessibility for people with learning disabilities. 
        I'd appreciate any useful ideas/references that you or anyone else reading this may have.

        Is this bookshelf documented on Kynn.COM, or would you consider sharing with us a short list of the references you find the most helpful?

        Hey, that's not a bad idea. 
        In fact, I encourage everyone else to share their favorite bookshelf collections 
        -- if relevant to WAI activities. 
        I'll post mine on kynn.com tomorrow when I'm back in the office.
