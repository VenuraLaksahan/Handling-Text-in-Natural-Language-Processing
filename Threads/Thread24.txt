        <Sent id="8.7"><Topic label=If word strips ALT tags>I even tried saving the file as .doc format, copying it under a different name.doc, reopening it in Word and saving it in HTML, and the ALT were still present (which proves that the ALT are somehow stored in the doc format)

        <Sent id="8.8"><Topic label=If word strips ALT tags>On the other hand, there was a lost of longdesc, link, and others new HTML4 table attributes; </Sent>
