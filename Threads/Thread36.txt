        <Sent id="2.1"><Topic label=white on black for disabled users>Jesper, It is my experience that many visually impaired users who still retain some eyesight prefer light text on dark backgrounds, especially when on a monitor screen. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3"><Topic label=white on black for disabled users>This is due in part to the fact that the &amp;quot;glare&amp;quot; from a white monitor screen is hard on the eyes, and can often wash out thin black lines (like text). </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4"><Topic label=white on black for disabled users>I personally know of at least 2 partially sighted users who have set up their machines with dark backgrounds and light text, even to the point of one setting their web browser to over-ride developers colours. </Sent>

        <Sent id="4.6"><Topic label=white on black for disabled users>I am aware that some people also swop between different settings, ie they may choose to work with black text on a white background in the morning, then as their eyes tire they might change their preferences to white text on a black background. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.7"><Topic label=importance of other schemes for style switches>Also, when implementing the style switcher it is important not to prevent people from using their own style sheet or browser preferences. </Sent>
        <Sent id="4.8"><Topic label=importance of other schemes for style switches>I have seen some switchers that do this and if the choices offered do not suit someone's needs it can be quite limiting. </Sent>

        <Sent id="6.2"><Topic label=white on black for disabled users>My understanding is that the original reason for using white (or green or orange) on black was that flicker is more obvious on large areas of solid white. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.3"><Topic label=white on black for disabled users>Viewing GUIs on CRTs, I get the impression that some rasterisers on some fonts don't handle white on black well (you need to handle them differently because a white pixel is larger than a black pixel, to ensure that adjacent white pixels overlap, when using a write white device, like a typical CRT.</Sent>
