		<Sent id="1.2"> <Topic label=Gathering locational data of researchers>hi all, As outlined at the face to face meet, I've been working on methods of getting coordinate information about the locations of Semantic web researchers and groups. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.3"> <Topic label=Gathering locational data of researchers>I wrote to the www-rdf-interest list asking for data: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.5"> <Topic label=Gathering locational data of researchers>so we'll have to see how that pans out. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.6"> <Topic label=Gathering locational data of researchers>Please do add yourselves if you've not already there (I just did a few as examples). 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.7"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>There are some SVG demos, developed from ones by Jim Ley, displaying the information we have already, which I constructed as examples: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.9"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>So, now we have to decide on the map which we will use to overlay the dots on. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.10"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>We want something that will highlight Europe, especially since on a world map, Europe is too small to really show up on provide the level of detail we require. </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.11"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>At ILRT, Caroline Meek, Dan and I have had discussions with a designer, and he has pointed us at some examples, and we've narrowed it down to two that we rather like: 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.13"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>which has the advantage of showing Europe as part of the world (we could get rid of the arm of the globe that is showing, and alter the colours); 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.15"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>which would be technically simpler to do, but shows Europe in isolation (I do like the colour scheme though). 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.16"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>Do people have a preference for one style over the other? 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.17"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>Could you let us know today if possible? </Sent>
        <Sent id="1.18"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>We need to specify the map as soon as possible in order to get postcards printed for www2003. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="1.21"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>p.s. Here's a nice similar idea:

        <Sent id="5.3"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>Hi Libby, The globe is too visually busy for a background (imho), and if you decrease the opacity I think you'll lose too much of the important bits (like where the UK is :-). </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4"> <Topic label=Choosing a map style>The map would be OK as a backdrop for the FOAF map if it was semi-opaque, but (a) it misses out the rest of the world, as you said yourself, and (b) there's a big blue empty space on the left :-). </Sent>
