        <Sent id="2.1"><Topic label=How to set up a usability lab>I'd use Netscape 3.x and 4.x, a version of MS Internet Explorer (as you can't have two versions on the same machine to my knowledge), a text browser such as lynx., PwWebSpeak for the voice browser and maybe Opera if you have extra time and money. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.2"><Topic label=How to set up a usability lab>Also to be considered is the use of a general screen reader such as Jaws For Windows. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.3"><Topic label=How to set up a usability lab>Use of tools such as bobby and HTML validators is also essential. </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.4"><Topic label=How to set up a usability lab>It might be sensible to have disabled users actually do the testing.

        <Sent id="3.2"><Topic label=Responding privately>(You are just the 1% prepared to put their hand up and ask...) 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.3"><Topic label=Responding privately>I would skip IE/Netscape, since designers worth 2c can tell you already how things work there by reading the code. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.4"><Topic label=Responding privately>The first thing I would do is validate the HTML and check with Bobby, but read the results and think about it rather than simply believing what you're told. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.5"><Topic label=Responding privately>For browsers I would look at Lynx, a screen reader (eg winvision, or jaws) and a proper audio browser like pwWebSpeak. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.6"><Topic label=Responding privately>If you can, use WebTV and a Macintosh version of things </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.7"><Topic label=Responding privately>- this will generally show up the problems much faster. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.8"><Topic label=Responding privately>The key is to learn where the problems arise so you can cut back the test/repair cycle. </Sent>
        <Sent id="3.9"><Topic label=Responding privately>It is a great efficiency if you can solve the problems by design rather than by repair.

</Sent>
        <Sent id="6.3"><Topic label=How to set up a usability lab>By the way, if you weren't aware, there's an emulator for WebTV that runs on Windows 95/* and Macintosh that you can download from developer.webtv.net. </Sent>
        <Sent id="6.4"><Topic label=How to set up a usability lab>I recommend it to my accessibility class students, since the more browsers you expose someone to, the quicker they realize that the web is designed to support ANY valid user agent, not just "the big two".
