</Sent>
        <Sent id="3.5"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>It's not the same, because a blind person can simply choose to -not- use an image if they feel they can't reasonably describe it...under the current guidelines. </Sent>

</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.2"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>There are lots of cases where a blind designer could use graphics as effectively, or actually more effectively, than a sighted person. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.3"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>These are cases where the graphics are selected or generated in a rule based or standardized way. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.4"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>For example, there are packages that generate flow charts from a textual description of a process. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>These insure a sensible flow chart... </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>at least a chart that "parses" correctly. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>On the other hand, I've seen too many flow chart style diagrams by sighted people where I have trouble understanding what conventions if any they're using.</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.8"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>I'll take a rule based design by a blind indivdiual any day. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.9"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>Other examples are graphs generated from data, schematic diagrams generated from pspice lists, and icons selected from a standardized set. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.10"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>Also, page layout and color selection can be made according to rules and standards. 
</Sent>
        <Sent id="5.11"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>Now, what about more creatively artistic uses of design, uses that can't be reduced to mathematical or verbal rules? </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.12"><Topic label=Effect of requirements on blind web designers>Well, first of all that goes beyond our guidelines: </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.13"><Topic label=Effect of requirements on blind web designers>we're just looking at usability and I think rule-based graphics should handle that. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.14"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>Second of all, I think there are certainly some blind individuals who can produce better art than some sighted individuals (better than me for example), certainly among people who have some vision and early visual experience. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.15"><Topic label=Capabilities of Blind web designers>As for art by people born blind... I'm not familiar with that area but I woudn't be surprised there's some remarkable use of shape and form.

        <Sent id="6.4"><Topic label=Attitudes towards accessibility requirements>We may be having a comprehension problem, but if you're going to react in a way that seems to question my "loyalty to cause" -- despite being willing to take the time needed to work through this issue, as my repeated email messages haven proven that I'm willing to do -- then you're likely to turn away even MORE people who could be your strongest allies.
