        <Sent id="2.6"><Topic label=Need to avoid Design debates in guidelines>I agree with this approach. Consistent with this approach, I feel, is a methodology of &amp;quot;guiding&amp;quot; which says &amp;quot;well, you -can- do it, but to do it right you have to do (x), (y), and (z), and that will still mean you're losing out on (a), (b), and (c), but if you REALLY REALLY WANT TO, hey, it's your choice.&amp;quot; </Sent>
        <Sent id="2.11"><Topic label=Need to avoid Design debates in guidelines>This isn't forbidding anything -- but it's making it clear that there are definite problems with certain approaches, and if someone chooses to follow that path, they at least will be aware of the consequences of their actions. </Sent>

        <Sent id="3.1"><Topic label=Need to avoid Design debates in guidelines>I think even WCAG 1.0 can be regarded as consistent with this method of specifying guidelines, in that the word &amp;quot;avoid&amp;quot; was deliberately chosen to imply the existence of alternative, more accessible, means of achieving the same objective. 
        <Sent id="3.2"><Topic label=Need to avoid Design debates in guidelines>WCAG 2.0 should, however, make this point clearer, to avoid (pun intended) giving the impression that there are prohibitions in the guidelines that would limit the capacity of content creators to design web sites that fulfill their respective purposes.</Sent>

        <Sent id="5.11"><Topic label=Relative needs of different groups>Excellent point -- the body of knowledge for disability access considerations, beyond those of blind people (which are generally well-explored these days), is pretty skimpy. </Sent>
		<Sent id="5.14"><Topic label=Relative needs of different groups>We're -still- in the exploration/discovery process of &amp;quot;what works&amp;quot;, and as we see more solutions like Reef's -- which allow you to build an interface for ONE audience without fearing interference with OTHER audiences' interfaces -- we will encounter more and more solutions which will work for some people and not work for others. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.19"><Topic label=Need to avoid Design debates in guidelines>Forbidding them outright will cause a lot of problems, in the same way that alternate interfaces stated &amp;quot;as a last resort&amp;quot; cause problems when usable, accessible design is your &amp;quot;first resort&amp;quot;! </Sent>
