        <Sent id="5.4"><Topic label=How to alert Screen readers of uncompleted form>Perhaps not, since putting spider-bait in alt attributes is just as old a search-engine as hiding stuff using colour. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.5"><Topic label=How to alert Screen readers of uncompleted form>On the other hand there isn't really anyway I can think of for spiders to know whether they are being baited unless there is a lot of repetition of words other than &amp;quot;a&amp;quot;, &amp;quot;the&amp;quot;, etc. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.6"><Topic label=How to alert Screen readers of uncompleted form>Spider-baiting in itself is quite a problem for users of text, whether sighted text-only users or users of enabling technologies. </Sent>
        <Sent id="5.7"><Topic label=How to alert Screen readers of uncompleted form>I've quite often come across sites with little for a text-only user to read but the keywords they want to be listed over repeated 50 times.</Sent>
