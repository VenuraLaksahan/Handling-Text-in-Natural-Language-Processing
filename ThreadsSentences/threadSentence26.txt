        Kynn's personal opinion, not one belonging to the WAI or the HTML Writers Guild -- 
        Adam Clayton Powell III? 
        Fearmonger and irresponsible journalist
 
        He thinks he's found &amp;quot;an issue&amp;quot; and has latched onto it in order to &amp;quot;save us from government,&amp;quot; but really he's just a kook

        The Freedom Forum's fear mongering aside, does anyone know what's up with the release of all the 508 accessibility regulations? 
        Why did the feds take such a closed-door approach when it was commonly expected that the info would be available on Feb
 7?

        Ya got me
 
        I don't see it as a closed-door approach, though, the way I read their announcement
 
        Maybe I'm just too trusting of gummit workers, but this seems more like typical bureaucracy slowness than any sort of concerted conspiracy to derive us of our rights
 :) 
        I suppose that Mr
 Yanchulis would be the one to ask, though: 
        For further information contact: 
        Dave Yanchulis, The Access Board 
        (202) 272-5434, ext
 127 (voice), 
        (202) 272-5449 (TTY)

        I think you are correct about the bureaucracy part
 
        However, being thorough can take time, if it's anything like our listserve
 :) 
        The linked announcement mentions that &amp;quot;

the standards will be published in the Federal Register and be made available for public comment&amp;quot;, so it sounds like it will eventually be opened up

        Yes, a little Civics 101 is in order
 
        The Federal Register _is_ the institution created expressly to make _sure_ citizens have the chance to comment on things before they are imposed
 
        For more information, please consult Federal Register

        Adam Clayton Powell III sounds about as lost as Thurston Powell III was on &amp;quot;Gilligans Island&amp;quot;!

        kelly, That is a good question and should be asked of our next guest, Doug Wakefield on our march 16 web cast at abletv
net
 
        I would add that any other questions you might want to ask doug, should be done on that evening
 
        please check out the exact time for when the webcast will happen under the press release link at abletv

        Actually, the government is not robbing us of our rights, but protecting us
 
        i know this sounds paradoxical, but it is true
 
        For any NOI (notice of inquiry), NPRM (notice of proposed rule making), etc
 the government must follow the procedures established in the apa (i believe it is known as the Americans procedural Act) of 1947, which outlines the procedures of putting the NOI and NPRM out for comment for a specific time period
 
        The problem is that when they do this and get a large response to a particular NPRM, they (the government) is obligated to read each and every one of the responses, corrolate them and summarize them into specific response categories, if possible
 
        They do this with a limited staff
 
        This is not to say that i don't get frustrated either, but just an expalnation of the process
 
        &amp;gt; I think you are correct about the bureaucracy part
