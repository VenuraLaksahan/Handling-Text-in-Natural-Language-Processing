      DefineDisability FIRST
      
        First define disability
 
        Someone can be disAbled by a congenital defect, chronic illnesses or injury
 
        It could be any combination of, or even multiple, congenital defects, illnesses and/or injuries
 
        There are also debilitating side effects of medications
 
        A &amp;quot;non-reader&amp;quot; is not necessarily blind 
        - they may have had a TBI (traumatic brain injury) or have a Learning Disability
 
        Disabilities can effect fine and gross motor skills
 
        (Arthritis is a common fine motor complaint) 
        A Quadriplegic may use different assistive technologies, such as voice pilots, mouth tools or devices that follow eye movement
 
        Some people type with their toes! 
        IMO, before you can define Accessibility you must first define disability

        &amp;gt; First define disability
 
        Why? 
        I view that anyone should be able to access information, regardless of whether or not they have a &amp;quot;disability
&amp;quot; 
        Your access shouldn't be _limited_ because you have a certain quality about you that other people don't have
 
        Regardless if we call that a &amp;quot;disability&amp;quot; or not, it should not interfere with your ability to access content on the Internet
 
        I think it's perfectly reasonable to define &amp;quot;accessibility&amp;quot; with having a strict definition of &amp;quot;disability&amp;quot; as long as your accessibility definition doesn't speak _only_ about access for people who fit that disability definition

        OK
 
        Here's my short definition: 
        &amp;quot;Disability is a design flaw in the environment
&amp;quot; 
        Here's the long version, from a chapter in an upcoming book on web-based training: 
        &amp;quot;People are not &amp;quot;disabled
&amp;quot; 
        A disability is a consequence of design flaws in the environment
 
        Some individuals, due to accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks, such as moving their legs, seeing, hearing, talking, grasping or lifting
 
        When these functional limitations are severe enough to adversely affect a person's performance, and the natural and human environments fail to accommodate their functional limitations, the individual is said to have a disability
&amp;quot; 
        You take your pick
 
        If I were rewriting it, I would say something like this: 
        


 ALL individuals, due to circumstance, accident, illness, or heredity, have difficulties performing -- or cannot perform -- certain tasks

        &amp;gt; OK
 
        &amp;gt; Here's my short definition: 
        &amp;gt; &amp;quot;Disability is a design flaw in the environment
&amp;quot; 
        I like to tell people that if a blind person can't access the web page she's trying to use, the REASON is not _her_ disability, but the disability of the _web author_ who created the page
 
        That web author is &amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot; because he was _not able_ to make a correct web page
 
        Why should she suffer for _his_ problem or failing? 
        In no way is a user with a disability &amp;quot;disabled&amp;quot; on the web 
        -- the sites THEMSELVES have the disability inherent in their code by not being accessible! 
        We should identify the problem where it exists
 
        The problem is not that there's anything &amp;quot;wrong with&amp;quot; the user, it is a problem with the page author and his output!

        I should like to add that we do have to accept that the victorians probably had an insuperable task in trying to design and build a wheelchair for a quadraplegic that the individual could control themselves
