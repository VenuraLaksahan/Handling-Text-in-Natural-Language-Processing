      Extending IETF meetings to two weeks?
      
         The IETF meetings tend to become too large, creating logistics and planning problems
 
         I suggest that future meetings are held for two weeks, with applications and user services issues the first week, and all other issues the second week
 
         Those who so wish could attend both weeks, and other people could attend only one week
 
         Those who choose to attend both weeks would be able to cover more groups and do better liaisons between the different areas
 
         The Friday of the first week could discuss applications issues which might be of special interest to the other areas, and the Monday of the second week would schedule other groups which might be of special interest to applications people, so some people could attend Monday-Monday or Friday-Friday

         My problem over the past year or so is that there are only a few session I wish to attend, but I cannot know for sure when they will be scheduled, so I cannot make reasonable travel arrangements (a week in Orlando for 6 hours of meetings is hard to sell to management)
 
         Now I know there is a rationale here, and that one is encouraged to participate broadly
 
         And I am hopeful that new activities (my own and in the IETF) will give me many more reasons to attend
 

         But firmer scheduling would be a big win

         Terry, WG Chairs already are asked to specify which clashes they want to avoid, but clash avoidance is an iterative problem
 
         I just don't see how late changes can be completely avoided
 
         Obviously, everybody knows they need to be minimised
 

         Jacob, No way
 
         Taking one week out of our calendars 3 times a year is already very painful, and a lot of people really do need and want to track multiple areas of the IETF
 
         Spreading it thinner would be awful

      create 'final' IETF agenda schedule earlier?
      
         Working groups don't seem to decide at the last minute whether or not they need a meeting, or what their conflict avoidance criteria needs to be
 
         This leads me to believe that we could create the IETF schedule earlier without causing significant pain
 

         For example, it would be very useful so that the final WG schedule was available more than 21 days in advance, in order to get advanced purchase tickets
 
         This would mean that the apps area schedule should be set tentatively 30-35 days in advance, so that the draft IETF schedule could be published and conflicts reviewed

         I'd like to second this notion
 
         Many folks in smaller companies are under severe budget constraints and have difficulty justifying participation in IETF meetings
 
         The advance notice helps reduce travel costs, which in turn helps more people attend
 

         It would make my life easier
