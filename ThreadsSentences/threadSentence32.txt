      Interesting Poll on Accessibility
      
        Dear All, I found this interesting Website accessibility poll on: http://www
iwks
com/default
asp 

        Apologies now in case this page is not accessible 
        - it's just that the results are very interesting and I would be happy to send an update to the list later on with the final results so we can all benefit from it

        It was indeed interesting 
        - I can't get at the results either with Opera or Lynx
 

        Yes, please, an update to the list of the data would be beneficial to us who do not maintain the same browsers or have the same capabilities as those who coded that very, very interesting albeit ironic poll

        The poll is halfway down on the right hand side of the page
 
        Sorry, the page was designed by a person with idea on usability
 
        A perennial portal problem


 

        The poll is just visible without scrolling down, underneath the Internet Works magazine image
 

        Are you viewing in graphics browser? 
        Does anyone need better directions?

        So far, the poll results say that 47% of the participants have no idea how to even make their site accessible, or what it means
 
        That's just wonderful news

        The poll did not display for me either, as you need scripting enabled to view it
 
        That's rather ironic considering the question

        Wonder how many of those have actually checked it, and aren't guessing 
        it might have been swayed by it being posted here, though)? :)

        Somebody on the list emailed the website yesterday to find out
 
        Maybe if the site responds, he'll forward the answer to the list

        And that person is still waiting to hear from the Webmaster
 

        I would also like to apologise for not posting the final results but Internet problems prevented me from accessing the site


 
        that was my end of things and not the site that was having problems
 
        I will email again today and see if I can get an answer for the list
 

        Further apologies for those who could not access the poll, but I think that this is often typical of sites that run articles or polls on accessibility, and a complaint has been logged with the site
