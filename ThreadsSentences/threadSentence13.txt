      Face to face meeting planning
      
        We had discussed the possibility of a meeting together with the ATIA conference http://www
atia
org/conf_2004
html
 
        ATIA is quite firm that they do not want any meetings to overlap with their events if we plan it through them
 
        I already have an IMS meeting scheduled for Saturday afternoon and Sunday (January 17th and 18th)
 
        Several people in ATAG are unavailable prior to the ATIA meetings
 
        This leaves two options, to plan our meetings in Orlando but not through ATIA or to hold the meetings on Monday the 19th and Tuesday the 20th
 
        Monday is Martin Luther King day
 
        What are your thoughts? 
        Can you suggest another venue and possible sponsor? 
        I am pursuing one other possibility but would like to hear back from the possible sponsor before I suggest it
 
        Thanks for your input

        I thought the IMS meeting was 16/17 ??? 
        MLK Day is never better than in Savannah! 
        maybe we could go there? 
        I personally don't want to spend my life in Orlando, thank you! 
        I have to be in NY on the 23rd and then plan to go home
 
        I am not essential to this meeting, but there are my constraints

        I have never had a holiday in Venice, although I would like to
 
        But I can confirm that it is a nice place to have a meeting, and could probably attend (it is not that hard to get to from Europe)

        Voglio andare a venezia! 
        oops 
        - one should not show such enthusiasm, I suspect! 
        Could we be careful to make the dates so that those of us who do come a long way can make it, please!

        If we can plan, what about planning the year, Australia included? 
        best time for us is anytime 
        - maybe northern winter from others' perspectives?

        Planning meetings a year in advance (at least tentatively) is a good idea
 
        I will add this to the agenda for the next call
