      Next face to face meeting
      
		 Dear all, a heads-up
 				 
         Hoping that we will have a last call review shortly (see my next email) we are planning a face to face meeting at which we can resolve issues raised, and generally tidy the document up (write up lots more good techniques)
 
         At the moment we are talking to a potential host in the Boston area about a meeting on thursday and friday 7-8 October
 
         More details as they come to hand

         Folks, please note that this meeting would be on at the same time as the ATIA meeting in Orlando, Florida
 
         If the time is impossible for anyone please let us know as soon as possible 
         - at the moment the next closest possible times are a week earlier (which will cut into the time available for last call review) or ten days later (which will possibly push our schedule back further)

         Dear working group participants, as discussed, the meeting will indeed be held on thursday 7 and friday 8 October
 
         I am pleased to announce that Allaire Corp will be our hosts, and look forward to a productive two days, and some time to say hi
 
         The nitty-gritty


 
         Meeting registration is open from now until 1 October
 
         register via the meeting page at http://www
w3
org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 which also provides details on location, accommodation, etc
 
         There are a limited number of rooms available in the Royal Sonesta Hotel (which is the meeting venue) at a discounted rate 
         - in order to qualify for this rate reservations and meeting registration must be completed by September 10
 
         Since October is the peak season for Boston hotels, rooms are expensive and hotels book out early, so you are advised to make your plans and reservations as soon as possible
 
         If you have any questions or special requirements please contact me as early as possible

         Most important - if you haven't registered yet, don't forget
 
         http://www
w3
org/WAI/AU/f2f-oct99 for the details
 
         Given that there are a small number of us, I thought I would ask what people want to eat for lunch
 
         The default choices are roast turkey breast with vegetables (without turkey if you are a vegan), and pasta with vegetable rataouille
 
         Possible substitutions: 
         baked Scrod (fish) 
         chicken caesar salad 
         hommus roll-up sandwich with salad 
         salad with crab cakes 
         churrasco flank steak with chimichurri (??) and onions 
         I will do this in the following way: 
         If you cannot eat one of these things please make that very clear
 
         It will take at least two votes to change something, and will have to be compatible with what people can't do
 
         The deadline is 3pm (boston time) Monday
 
         No response will not be considered a vote for the default 
         - it will be considered a vote for &amp;quot;whatever gets chosen&amp;quot; 
         Sorry to bore you with administrivia, but I figure that having food that people like helps the meeting go well
