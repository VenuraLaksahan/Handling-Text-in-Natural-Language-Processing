      word comprhension
      
        I have noticed that when using a screen reading browser such as IBM homepage reader when words are joined together for example &amp;quot;homepage&amp;quot; the words &amp;quot;home&amp;quot; and &amp;quot;page&amp;quot; are not recognised, as a consequence the joined words become incomprehensible to the screenreading software
 
        I haven't found any references to this within the gudielines
 
        have i missed them?

1 Use the clearest and simplest language appropriate


 [priority 1] 
        Of course at some point speech technology needs to learn how to deal with common but new terms in a language
 
        Homepage is one that I would expect to work - especially in a product whose name includes the term
 
        But Text to Speech is an inexact science - even people who are experts cannot agree to pronounce words the same way
 
        Just ask a well-trained and very literate American chemist what the eleme whose symbol is Al is called - they tell you about a thing called &amp;quot;aluminum&amp;quot;
 
        But they are in fact referring to what any Australian voice recogniser would expect to hear as al-(y)a-min-(i)-yum
 
        The problem is funnier (after people get over the inconvenience of learning about it) when a screen reader uses a finnish or swedish synthesiser but provides its cues and prompts in english

        No, it's not obvious at all
 
        Yes, when in doubt, hypenate compounds if you have any doubt as to how long they have been in the language
 
        Some screen readers will successfully divide camelCase agglutinations
 
        I don't know how widespread this is, though
 
        You would have to have the memory of an elephant to pull up the following flames
 
        But they do touch on text-to-speech, along with lay persons, people operating in a second language, and others with reading difficulty as at risk on account of unusual words including neologisms: 
        The point is to have and apply a reasonably small word list and handle those things that fall outside this list as special
 
        My spell-checker in Eudora 4 bounces 'homepage' and suggests &amp;quot;home page&amp;quot; as a possible correction
 
        Need we say more? 
        It could be as simple as &amp;lt;acronym title=&amp;quot;home page&amp;quot;&amp;gt; homepage &amp;lt;/acronym&amp;gt; although purists will yell at me

        There is probably a good argument for raising the issue of proper names
 
        In my brief experience it seems that common dictionary words are read well enough
 
        However it seems that people and place names are not
 
        These are the very words that are of greatest interest
 
        it would also be great to see a decent ua that offered alternative readings (as per spell checker example), a memorise function, and possibly the opportunity to share the choice with a public database
 
        Perhaps somone knows of this?

        It would appear that this is readily available using Speech synthesis markup language and XSLT (or XSLT 2 perhaps)


 
        or someone can make smarter and smarter speech synthessisers
 
        If Audio CSS allowed something equivalent to SSML's say-as propoerty, we would be closer perhaps

        Sorry, you are missing the main brunt of Jonathan's remarks
 
        Yes, SSML, modularized, provides the WCAG piece
 
        But who/how accesses the dictionary? 
        One of the creative things he raises is uploading your pronunciation repairs to the community
 
        What Annotea would like to do
 
        But personal data is in LDAP today, not RDF
 
        So we need LDAP bindings for the SSML
 
        To make the web whole
