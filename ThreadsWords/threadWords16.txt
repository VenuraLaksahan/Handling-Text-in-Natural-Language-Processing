WCAG
Conference
call
TODAY

Just
a
reminder:

we
are
holding
a
conference
call
today
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
is
a
holiday
(Thanksgiving)
in
the
US

I
don't
know
if
any
of
our
editors
will
be
on
the
call,
so
I
suggest
we
use
the
time
to
discuss
Wendy's
draft
charter

It
can
be
found
at:
http://www
w3
org/WAI/GL/new-charter-2000
html


Attendance
at
today's
meeting
is
optional
for
our
American
colleagues

If
you
have
to
choose
between
turkey
and
talking,
I
will
understand
if
you
opt
for
the
food

by
the
way,
does
anyone
have
any
comments
or
suggestions
on
the
Case
Study
we
submitted
on
how
to
make
Macromedia
accessible?

Would
like
to
modify
the
50
State
Quarter
Interactive
Map
at

We
are

these
for
other
products
and
one
is
in
development
now


Comments?

Re:

I
beleive
WAI
and
assume
W3C
policy
is
that
meeting
announcements,
including
an
agenda
should
be
posted
to
the
list
at
least
24
hours
prior
to
a
telecon
meeting

I
have
tried
to
adhere
to
this
policy
in
the
UA
working
group
and
I
think
it
has
help
keep
people
interested
in
the
participating
in
the
telecons
