RE:

text

background

Jesper,
It
is
my
experience
that
many
visually
impaired
users
who
still
retain
some
eyesight
prefer
light
text
on
dark
backgrounds,
especially
when
on
a
monitor
screen

This
is
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
the
&amp;quot;glare&amp;quot;
from
a
white
monitor
screen
is
hard
on
the
eyes,
and
can
often
wash
out
thin
black
lines
(like
text)

I
personally
know
of
at
least
2
partially
sighted
users
who
have
set
up
their
machines
with
dark
backgrounds
and
light
text,
even
to
the
point
of
one
setting
their
web
browser
to
over-ride
developers
colours

&amp;gt;
Hi

I
am
aware
that
some
people
also
swop
between
different
settings,
ie
they
may
choose
to
work
with
black
text
on
a
white
background
in
the
morning,
then
as
their
eyes
tire
they
might
change
their
preferences
to
white
text
on
a
black
background

Also,
when
implementing
the
style
switcher
it
is
important
not
to
prevent
people
from
using
their
own
style
sheet
or
browser
preferences

I
have
seen
some
switchers
that
do
this
and
if
the
choices
offered
do
not
suit
someone's
needs
it
can
be
quite
limiting

Hi
Jesper
Will
you
be
including
any
other
colour
schemes?

Black
on
gold
and
black
on
certain
shades
of
blue
can
improve
readability
for
some
dyslexics

My
understanding
is
that
the
original
reason
for
using
white
(or
green
or
orange)
on
black
was
that
flicker
is
more
obvious
on
large
areas
of
solid
white

Viewing
GUIs
on
CRTs,
I
get
the
impression
that
some
rasterisers
on
some
fonts
don't
handle
white
on
black
well
(you
need
to
handle
them
differently
because
a
white
pixel
is
larger
than
a
black
pixel,
to
ensure
that
adjacent
white
pixels
overlap,
when
using
a
write
white
device,
like
a
typical
CRT
