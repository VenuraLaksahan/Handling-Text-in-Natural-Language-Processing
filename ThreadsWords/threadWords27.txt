Re:

poll
for
screen
reader
users

Hi,
So
far,
about
24
screen
reader
users
have
sent
in
votes

One
person
didn't
like
the
screen
reader
version
because
of
the
long
links

What
he
didn't
realize
was
that
the
links
were
the
same
for
both
versions

He
just
hadn't
run
into
them
in
the
standard
version
before
trying
the
version
for
screen
reader
users

Two
other
users
forgot
to
make
a
choice

The
remaining
21
users
preferred
the
version
formatted
for
screen
readers
over
the
standard
version

A
couple
of
people
commented
that
they
would
want
some
more
text
on
the
screen
reader
version

All
I
get
are
the
&amp;quot;notify&amp;quot;

lead
to
forms
to

(These
work

No

Sounds

RE:

I
don't
get
any
unusual
code
(other
than
the
CFM
declaration
at
the
top)

Otherwise
it
looks
pretty
normal,
&amp;amp;amp;
reads
just
fine
with
JFW3
5

A
few
small
problems
such
as
ALT
text
&amp;quot;pages\cleardot1
gif&amp;quot;
(approx
),
but
nothing
really
unusual

Unless
there
is
some
CFM-generated
applet
thing
happening
that
I'm
missing
completely
