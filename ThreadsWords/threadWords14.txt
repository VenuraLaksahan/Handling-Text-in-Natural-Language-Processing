Non-geek
version
of
guidelines

Hello
Education
and
Outreach
Colleagues,
I
was
talking
to
a
friend
today
--
an
amateur
web
developer
and
professional
disability
rights
advocate
--
who
complained
that
the
W3C
guidelines
are
overly
technical
for
her
needs

She
wants
a
plain
language
version
of
the
guidelines

As
she
is
fairly
technologically
savvy,
she
expressed
frustration
at
having
to
work
so
hard
to
understand
what
must
be
done
to
make
accessible
web
pages

To
illustrate
her
point,
she
read
me
the
Quick
Tip
card
description
of
Image
map

I
agree
with
her,
the
tone
is
definitely
geeky

But
not
everyone
who
develops
web
pages
speaks
the
language
of
client-side
servers
and
hotspots

I
would
guess
that
most
people
who
develop
web
pages
are
amateurs
(in
the
original
sense
of
the
word:
from
amore
or
amour:
an
activity
done
out
of
love
)

Will
these
people
freeze
when
they
read
&amp;quot;make
line
by
line
reading
sensible?&amp;quot;
or
&amp;quot;Use
CSS?&amp;quot;

How
about
we
create
a
&amp;quot;user-friendly&amp;quot;
version
of
the
Web
Content
guidelines?

Maybe
a
primer

Re:

you
are
not
the
first
to
ask
about
this

this
si
a
part
of
obtaining
buy-in
from
the
user
community
so
implementation
will
go
easier

comments

Re:

What
about
the
WCAG
Curriculum?

Particularly
the
Example
Set
of
the
WCAG
Curriculum?

Curriculum:
http://www
starlingweb
com/wai/wcag/

Example
set:
http://www
starlingweb
com/wai/wcag/sam1-0
htm

Please
note
that
the
curriculum
will
be
moving
to
W3C
space
in
the
next
week
or
so

Don't
bookmark
pages
in
the
above
site
as
they
will
soon
be
invalid

Once
the
curriculum
is
in
the
W3C
space,
WAI
EO
will
likely
start
promoting
it
more
heavily
