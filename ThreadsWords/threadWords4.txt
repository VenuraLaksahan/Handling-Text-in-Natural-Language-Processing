Yes

I

my

informal

to
indicate
that
if
we
have
any

it

I
suspect
that
is
also
the
real
deadline,
in
that
I
imagine
they
want
to
make
their
final

at
Cannes

happy

draft
a

pretty
vacuous,

e-mail
vote

That

a

working
assumption

I've
been
announcing
telecon's
in
advance
and
cancelling
if
not
needed
to
keep
within
w3c
