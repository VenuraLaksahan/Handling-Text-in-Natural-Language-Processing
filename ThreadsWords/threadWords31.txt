Peepo
has
advocated
for
some
years
the
use
of
the
keyboard
as
means
to
select
links

In
the
latest
mozilla
browser,
when
you
type
a
letter,
except
in
a
text
entry
box,
it
cycles
through
links
that
have
that
letter
in
their
text

it
seems
slightly
buggy,
but
what
do
you
think?

(course
it
screws
my
coding
right
and
proper)

i
found
out
about
this
only
a
few
days
ago
and
have
been
using
the
so-called
'typeaheadfind'
since
then
quite
a
lot

i
haven't
found
it
buggy
at
all
and
absolutely
love
it

it's
more
a
Find
function
then
a
'cycling
through
links'
function

with
the
focus
on
the
page
you
just
type
a
word
(or
beginning
of
it)
and
mozilla
jumps
to
that
word

F3
finds
the
next
instance

it
first
only
looks
at
links
but
if
you
type
a
'/'
(slash)
before
the
word
it
searches
the
whole
text

it
really
just
saves
you
bringing
up
that
cumbersome
Find
dialogue
box

i
don't
think
it
really
works
for
cycling
through
links

the
tab
key
works
better
for
that

well
those
are
some
of
the
positives,
how
about
disabling
for
those
who
are
hyperactive,
and
just
cannot
stop
fiddling
with
the
keyboard?

its
buggy
in
the
sense
that
for
instance
'k'
words
aren't
just
those
that
start
with
the
letter
k
but
also
those
that
include
the
letter
k

I'd
expect
it
to
have
a
few
others
besides
