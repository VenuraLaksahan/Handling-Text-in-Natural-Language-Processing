better
Australian
time
for
regular
teleconferences

Liddy
has
been
admirably
getting
up
at
2am
on
a
regular
basis
to
join
our
call

I
don't
think
we
should
continue
to
ask
her
to
do
that

I
would
like
to
find
an
alternative
time
that
works
for
everyone
that
regularly
attends
the
teleconference

This
needs
to
take
into
account
European
time,
Australian
time
and
both
east
and
west
coast
North
American
time

How
is
everyone
with
4:00pm
EDT
on
Monday,
Tuesday
or
Wednesday?

This
would
make
it
6:00am
in
Australia
and
9:00
pm
in
Europe

Or
does
anyone
have
an
alternative
suggestion?

Re:

According
to
the
International
Meeting
Planner,
Jutta's
suggestion
of
4pm
EST
is
pretty
good

-
although
it
is
actually
10pm
in
Europe

3pm
EST
would
be
5am
in
Australia
and
9pm
in
Europe

&amp;gt;
How
is
everyone
with
4:00pm
EDT
on
Monday,
Tuesday
or
Wednesday?

&amp;gt;
This
would
make
it
6:00am
in
Australia
and
9:00
pm
in
Europe

&amp;gt;
Or
does
anyone
have
an
alternative
suggestion?

I
believe
4
00pm
on
Tuesday
would
clash
with
the
IMS
meetings,
if
they
continue
at
that
time

Re:

Hi
Jutta,
The
same
issue
arose
a
few
weeks
ago
in
the
PF
group

It
is
very
difficult
to
find
a
common
time
that
works
for
every
time
zone

10pm
Central
European
Time
means
I
can
make
some
of
the
calls,
but
not
all
of
them,
but
I
understand
the
change

&amp;gt;
Liddy
has
been
admirably
getting

2am

don't

RE:

I
hesitate
to
speak
for
Heather,
but
in
her
absence,
the
time
is
do-able
here
in
Pacific
time;

however,
at
glancing
at
her
schedule
she
may
have
conflicts
with
this
time,
at
least
on
Mondays/Wednesdays

--Tuesdays
look
like
a
30
minute
conflict
(at
the
last
1/2
hour)

I
don't
know
if
these
are
times
that
she
can
adjust
or
not

She'll
be
back
and
able
to
speak
for
her
own
schedule
next
week

When
did
you
need
to
make
a
firm
decision?

Re:

I
will
be
in
Europe
for
a
few
weeks
soon
and
so
we
could
have
meeting
times
that
suit
the
meetings

-
boring
but
maybe
better
for
actual
events?
