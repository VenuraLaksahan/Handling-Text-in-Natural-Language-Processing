There
has
been
very
little
comment
either
way
on
this
at
the
meeting
or
on
the
list

The
problem
is
that
W3C
rules
require
6
weeks
notice
of
meetings
which
I
believe
applies
to
time
and
location

Assuming
this
is
true,
I
think
we
have
to
go
with
the
UC
Irvine
location
unless
we
want
to
postpone
the
meeting

If

do
"it"

My
vote
is
for
Seattle
rather
than
Redmond,

we
are
are
all
camping
at
"Bill's

you
are

to
have
us
shuttle
in
from
SeaTac
to
the
private
Microsoft

Staging
in
Seattle
saves
the
bulk

us
the
drive
out

Redmond


I
myself

rather
see
us
there
staying
at
someplace
like
the
Edgewater
than
in
Redmond
by
far

It's
really
easier
to
get
to
and
has
more
night-life,

A
number

us
have
personal
experience
of
the
Edgewater's
facilities
from
one
of

a
