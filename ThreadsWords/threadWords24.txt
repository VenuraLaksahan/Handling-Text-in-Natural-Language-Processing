can
anyone

I'm

(There's
no
&amp;lt;/IMG&amp;gt;&amp;lt;ALT&amp;gt;

)

That's
about
what
I'd
expect

with

any

I

RE:
Why
word?

Many
people
required
to
edit
and
create
web
pages
and/or
sites
are
not
web
professionals
and
the
only
"WYSIWYG"
tool
available
to
them
is
Word

I
daresay
that
most
people
don't
know
HTML
and
are
not
going
to
learn
it
so
that
they
can
make
an
accessible
page
through
a
text
editor

This
is
especially
true
if
the
only
editing
required
of
them
is
small
such
as
changing
the
grammar
on
a
web
page
or
correcting
spelling
of
a
word

This
is
exactly
why
the
authoring
tools
aspect
of
the
WAI
is
so
important

&gt;
PS:

edit
an
HTML
document?!


MS-Word
has
elegant
text-editing
commands
that
are
absent
from
a
basic
text
editor,
and
that
make
editing
documents
a
pleasure

For
example,
you
can
quickly
move
entire
lines
or
paragraphs
without
using
the
clipboard;


select
words,
sentences,
and
paragraphs
by
pressing
a
single
key;

and
undo
and
redo
100
levels

All
of
the
above
can
be
done
using
keyboard
and
point-and-click
techniques

So
there
is
a
lot
of
versatility


Unfortunately,
many
of
the
really
powerful
Word
commands
are
extremely
poorly
documented


Furthermore,
savvy
Word
users
can
create
special-purpose
editing
commands
in
Visual
Basic
to
enhance
the
usefulness
of
the
word
processor
as
a
text
editor


Why
use
Word?

Because
it
is
a
good
tool
for
the
job

the

described
when
I
tested
this
on
my
own
system
using
MS
Word
97
for
Windows

I
followed
the
scenario
with
a
simple
test
page
(created
in
Netscape
Page
Composer)
with
a
Heading,
one
line
of
text,
and
an
image
with
ALT=
text

I
opened
the
HTML
file
in
Word97,
added
one
word
to
the
text
of
the
Heading,
then
saved
the
file
back
to
HTML
with
a
new
name

The
ALT=
text
was
not
affected

MS
Word
97,
at
least,
seems
to
recognize
HTML
and
preserve
it

Obviously,
other
versions
of
Word
may
behave
differently

I
suspect
that
*any*
word
processor
would
strip
the
ALT=
text
if
you
first
save
the
document
in
its
*native*
format,
then
try
to
save
it
back
to
HTML

Re:

&gt;
I
could
test
this
on
my
system
if
you
can
confirm
the
scenario:


&gt;
-
Start
with
an
HTML
document,
created
by
any
means


&gt;
-
The
doc
contains
an
&amp;lt;IMG&amp;gt;
with
the
ALT=
attribute


&gt;
-
The
HTML
doc
is
opened
in
Word
and
some
text
on
the
page
is
changed
or
added


&gt;
-
The
page
is
"Saved
as
HTML"
from
Word,
without
first
saving
it
in
Word
format


I
tried
that
with
Word
97
and
there
was
no
lost
of
ALT


I
even
tried
saving
the
file
as
doc
format,
copying
it
under
a
different
name
doc,
reopening
it
in
Word
and
saving
it
in
HTML,
and
the
ALT
were
still
present
(which
proves
that
the
ALT
are
somehow
stored
in
the
doc
format)


On
the
other
hand,
there
was
a
lost
of
longdesc,
link,
and
others
new
HTML4
table
attributes;

in
fact,
in
looks
like
unknown
attributes
are
pruned
out,
which
shouldn't
happen
(unknown
elements
are
kept,
albeit
mess
up
with,
see
below)


The
DOCTYPE
and
the
STYLE
I
had
in
this
test
file
were
moved
from
the
top
and
the
head
to
the
body,
which
is
really
bad
