Try
Unsubscribing&amp;ndash;&amp;ndash;You
Can't

Chris
Lilley,
Brian
Stell
and
others
have
been
discussing
the
rash
of
irate,
&amp;quot;get
me
off
this
list&amp;quot;
mesages
the
listserv
has
received,
lately

Well,
folks:
YOU
CAN'T
UNSUBSCRIBE
FROM
THIS
LIST!

I've
tried
for
2
months
to
get
off
this
list,
I've
followed
the
rules,
I've
tried
variations
of
the
theme,
looking
for
some
hidden
code--all
to
no
avail

So,
the
last
resort
of
those
who
have
tried
everything
else
is
to
post
to
the
list
they
want
to
be
rid
of

It's
irony,
but
it's
a
fact

PLEASE
GET
ME
OFF
THIS
LIST

get
off

Please!
Take

remain

Our
automated
list
manager
works
very
well

Sometimes
there
are
problems
due
to:

-
you
being
subscribed
under
another
name/address
--

this
was
the
case
for
the
first
among
the
two
recent
messages

-
you
being
subscribed
to
a
mail
exploder
in
the
company
you
work
for
--

this,
I
believe,
was
the
case
for
the
second
person

Please
talk
to
your
sysadm
about
this
problem
--

there
is
nothing
we
can
do

after

that
informed
me
of
this,
I
responded
with
an
unsubscribe
e-mail
with
my
unaliased
e-mail
address,
and
today
received
an
automated
response
informing
me
that
your
software
could
not
find
my

on
your

I
am
very

I
simply
want

Re:

Thanks
for
the
helpful
info,
but
I
just
received
a
message
saying
that
I
have
been
removed
from
the
list

Why?

Because
I
posted
my
difficulties
to
the
list

Sorry
I
had
to
burden
you
all
with
my
problems,
but
as
you
can
see,
it
worked
