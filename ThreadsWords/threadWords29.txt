I
have
built
a
form
which
has
a
submit
button
on
it

If
the
user
activates
the
button
and
hasn't
filled
out
the
form
correctly,
a
javascript
'alert'
pop-up
is
presented
to
the
user,
giving
more
information

This
appears
to
be
in
breach
of
checkpoint
10
1

Would
it
be
acceptable
to
provide
a
warning
message,
something
like
'Submitting
this
form
may
result
in
a
pop-up
dialog
being
displayed'
before
the
submit
button,
in
the
same
color
as
the
background?

Thus
(I
believe)
making
the
text
available
to
screen
reader
users
but
not
to
sighted
users?

It
also
depends
on
how
the
screen
reader
gets
its
content
-

readers
that
are
too
smart
about
colours
(a
useful
feature)
will
realise
that
the
text
is
invisible
and
skip
it

given
the
way
this
is
normally
used
to
stuff
keywords
in
pages,
it
is
not
a
bad

Perhaps
not,
since
putting
spider-bait
in
alt
attributes
is
just
as
old
a
search-engine
as
hiding
stuff
using
colour

On
the
other
hand
there
isn't
really
anyway
I
can
think
of
for
spiders
to
know
whether
they
are
being
baited
unless
there
is
a
lot
of
repetition
of
words
other
than
&amp;quot;a&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;the&amp;quot;,
etc

Spider-baiting
in
itself
is
quite
a
problem
for
users
of
text,
whether
sighted
text-only
users
or
users
of
enabling
technologies

I've
quite
often
come
across
sites
with
little
for
a
text-only
user
to
read
but
the
keywords
they
want
to
be
listed
over
repeated
50
times
