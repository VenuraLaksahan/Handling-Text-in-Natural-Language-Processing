Peter,
to
clear
up
a
possible
confusion,
can
you
confirm
that
you're
use
of
SLD
refers
to
specific
learning
difficulty
or
dyslexia,
and
not
Severe
Learning
Difficulties
or
cognitive
disability?

looks
to
be
a
great
resource,
we
now
link
to
it
and

from

where
there
are
links
to
many
other
useful
resources
on
LDD
and
the
web

hi,
The
paper
cover
Dyslexia
and
Dyslexic-like
specific
learning
difficulties

But
it
does
it
does
not
specifically
cover
the
&amp;quot;learning
disabled&amp;quot;,
&amp;quot;Severe
Learning
Difficulties&amp;quot;
or
Cognitive
disabilities

My
remit
is
for
those
who
could
be
potentially
studying
at
a
minimum
of
a
Further
Educational
level

You
might
find
that
the
paper
covers
many
of
the
issues
but
it
completely
side-steps
the
issues
when
a
student
has
a
savere
language
difficulty
or
savere
cognition
problem



I
would
need
to
go
into
talking
about
the
appropriateness
of
content,
symbolic
communications

etc
etc

I
do
hope
within
the
future
to
write
a
similar
paper
about
web
accessibility
for
those
with
hearing
impairment
(including
pre-lingually
deaf)
