Face
to
face
meetings

There
have
been
a
couple
of
possiblities
raised:


Ottawa,
5
or
6
October
(This
depends
on
a
number
of
other
W3C
timing
issues)


Nashville,
mid
october


How
do
people
feel
about
either
of
these?

Are
we
ready
for
a
meeting,
overdue
for
one,
nowhere
near
it?

Are
these
good
locations,
or
does
someone
have
another
proposal
(offer
of
hosting


)

Re:

I
think
we
should
have
something
more
concrete
to
meet
about

-
something
that
doesn't
lend
itself
to
list/telecon
handling


Plus
it
would
be
extremely
helpful
if
more
than
one
WG
met
around
the
same
time/place

Not
necessarily
in
conjunction
with
some
"external"
event

I
think
a
face-to-face
is
a
good
idea
and
have
no
problems
with
either
of
the
dates
suggested

The
Nashville
conference
is
the
Educause
conference
from
October
10-13

All
courseware
developers
will
be
attending

Norman
Coombs
and
I
will
be
presenting
on
accessible
courseware
authoring

Information
about
the
event
is
at:
http://www
educause
edu/conference/e2000


For
the
face
to
face
meeting
we
had
talked
about
having
a
working
meeting

We
would
have
a
set
of
tasks
ie

Techniques
for
specific
checkpoints,
designing
the
conformance
document,
evaluating
representative
tools

We
would
break
out
into
small
groups
to
create
drafts
and
then
gather
as
a
whole
group
to
review
the
drafts


&gt;
There
have
been
a
